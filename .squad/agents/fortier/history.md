# Project Context

- **Owner:** Brady
- **Project:** squad-sdk — the programmable multi-agent runtime for GitHub Copilot (v1 replatform)
- **Stack:** TypeScript (strict mode, ESM-only), Node.js ≥20, @github/copilot-sdk, Vitest, esbuild
- **Created:** 2026-02-21

## Learnings

### From Beta (carried forward)
- Event-driven over polling: always prefer event-based patterns
- Streaming-first: async iterators over buffers — this is a core design principle
- Graceful degradation: if one session dies, others survive
- Node.js ≥20: use modern APIs (structuredClone, crypto.randomUUID, fetch, etc.)
- ESM-only: no CJS shims, no dual-package hazards
- Cost tracking and telemetry: runtime performance is a feature, not an afterthought
